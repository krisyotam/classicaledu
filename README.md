#### Purpose
I am 20 and single. Gladly realizing the grave errors made in my own early formative years, I have decided to dedicate myself to reviving "Classical Education." This project is a complete revision of the traditional classical education from the ground up. Modern times require modern solutions. There will be many similarities to other traditional classical curricula, and a lot of the material will be based on [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/). More will be added than removed, and some elements will be swapped. I want this education to be as optimal as possible, which requires quite obscure knowledge to be crowdsourced on very esoteric subjects. For example, during the study of Calculus, we will consider whether to go with Spivak, Larson, or Stewart, examining the advantages each book provides and why one might be better suited for a particular student than another. This curriculum may draw from several distinct sources, taking only the necessary portions from each.

One of the most significant differences from traditional classical curricula will be the focus on African American ancestry. I believe identity is one of the biggest issues that children, and later adults, face, stemming from a fundamentally flawed education system. I encourage anyone to take this curriculum and further modify the sections on historical studies to best suit their needs.
