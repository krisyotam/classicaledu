#### Purpose
I am 20 and single. Gladly realizing the grave errors made in my own early formative years, I have decided to dedicate myself to reviving "Classical Education." This project is a complete revision of the traditional classical education from the ground up. Modern times require modern solutions. There will be many similarities to other traditional classical curricula, and a lot of the material will be based on [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/). More will be added than removed, and some elements will be swapped. I want this education to be as optimal as possible, which requires quite obscure knowledge to be crowdsourced on very esoteric subjects. For example, during the study of Calculus, we will consider whether to go with Spivak, Larson, or Stewart, examining the advantages each book provides and why one might be better suited for a particular student than another. This curriculum may draw from several distinct sources, taking only the necessary portions from each.

One of the most significant differences from traditional classical curricula will be the focus on African American ancestry. I believe identity is one of the biggest issues that children, and later adults, face, stemming from a fundamentally flawed education system. I encourage anyone to take this curriculum and further modify the sections on historical studies to best suit their needs.

#### Ideas
If you happen to be following any of my other work then you will be widely aware of my [Classical Mathematics]() project. Due to my personal bias and hearts marriage to mathematics that project will be far more in depth that I go into any other subject. If you have a passion for mathematics as well depending on the point you are reading this you could sub that curricula in for the mathematics done here. As mentioned earlier this will be mainly using memoria press.

#### Goals 
My goal at the moment is to start with self-education; therefore, I will be using several techniques from books like [Ultralearning](<insert-link-here>), [<insert-title-here>](<insert-link-here>), [<insert-title-here>](<insert-link-here>), etc., and other strategies like [Immersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion). The first project will be an adult learning path. Many may see it as unnecessary, but I would hate to teach something I don't understand, especially to my own children. This in no way means that I would limit their knowledge to my own; rather, if I am to teach them a Classical Lifestyle, I must follow one myself. Thus, this "Adult Learning Path" will be an ultralearning project for parents or enthusiasts whose formative years have passed and want to return to learn from the roots.

#### Paths
- [ A ] Adult Ultra-learning Path (In-Progress)
- [ B ] Gentler Parent Overview Path (Backlog) --> good overview of curricula, its purpose, the history, and how to analyze work without spending thousands of hours on the work. 
- [ C ] Advanced Student Path (Backlog) --> advanced ad fontes education with expert chosen resources to expand out several fields. 
- [ D ] Supplemental Path (Backlog) --> for students in public school to supplement their own education. 
- [ E ] Revised General Student Path (Backlog)
